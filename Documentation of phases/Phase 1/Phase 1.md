# Phase 1 - Fintech 👨‍💻

## 🎯 Phase 1 Objective
In the first phase of the project, the focus was to understand the market and plan the development of the application. This included a detailed analysis of competing apps, identifying strengths and weaknesses, as well as opportunities for innovation. From this research, a vision document was created to define the app's value proposition, using the Elevator Pitch model to clearly and concisely communicate the project's purpose.

## 🗺️ Story Mapping
The initial phase also involved the creation of a Story Mapping, which outlines the main functionalities of the app, such as user registration, income and expense tracking, and the generation of a personalized "financial trail" based on the information provided by the user. This trail serves as a guide to help users achieve their financial goals in a structured way.

## 🚀 Overall Objective
The goal of this phase was to establish a solid foundation for the development of the application, ensuring that it meets the real needs of users and stands out in the market for its simplicity and effectiveness. The project is constantly evolving, aiming to promote financial education and make money management more accessible to everyone. 💡
