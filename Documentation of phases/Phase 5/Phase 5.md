# Phase 5 - Fintech Project ðŸš€  

## ðŸ§© OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)  
In the second semester of our first year, we were introduced to **Java programming** with a focus on **OOP principles**. We covered Java fundamentals and the core pillars of OOP: **polymorphism**, **inheritance**, and **encapsulation**.  

## ðŸ’» Java Methods - Fintech Class Implementation  
In this project, we began developing the core functionalities of the **Fintech system** using Java and OOP paradigms. The work was done in **pair programming** with a classmate, fostering knowledge sharing and collaborative coding.  

## ðŸ§¬ Inheritance & Polymorphism - Applied to Fintech Classes!  
Building on the previous activity, we implemented **inheritance** and **polymorphism** in the Fintech systemâ€™s classes. This task was also completed in collaboration with my teammate, reinforcing our hands-on learning.
