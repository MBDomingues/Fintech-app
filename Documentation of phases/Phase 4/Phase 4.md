# Phase 4 - Fintech Project 🚀

## 🌐 View
In the fourth phase of the project, the focus was on learning HTML and CSS with JavaScript interactions, as well as using the Bootstrap framework for styling and practicality in creating pages. We learned how these interactions work, the front-end part, and the user experience to create responsive and aesthetically pleasing websites.

## 💻 Stylish Development Without the Struggle and Developers' Social Network
In the activity Stylish Development Without the Struggle and Developers' Social Network, I was challenged to transform the screen prototypes created in Figma into code using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The goal was to develop the first screens of what the Fintech project will look like.

#### Notes:The screens were created with a focus on mobile devices, following the Mobile-First concept 📱.

It's worth noting that, depending on when you access this repository, the design and code may undergo changes, as this is just the beginning of the Fintech Project. The code will be continuously improved and evolved throughout the next phases, with new functionalities and adjustments being implemented. 🔄
