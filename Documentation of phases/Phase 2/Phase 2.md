# Phase 2 - Fintech ✍

## 🛠️ Prototyping
In this phase, we began developing the initial templates, defining the future vision of the project. The focus was on learning how to design screens and gaining a deeper understanding of user experience (UX), primarily using the Scrum concept for agile project development.

## 🎨 Creating Fintech Screens with Figma
Prototyping is the activity dedicated to creating the first visual prototype of what the final version of the project will look like. This prototype was developed using Figma, following the mobile-first concept to ensure good usability on mobile devices. It is worth noting that this initial version is subject to changes throughout the development process. 🔄
