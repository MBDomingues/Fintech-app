# Phase 3 - Fintech Project 🚀

## 🖥️ Modeling
In the third phase of the year, we were introduced to the concept of database modeling with Oracle. We learned how to structure a database and applied best modeling practices, creating logical and physical models that efficiently represent relationships and data. This knowledge is essential for building a well-structured and functional database.

## Logical Model of Fintech 📄

In the Logical Model of Fintech, we developed the logical and physical model that will serve as the foundation for the fintech project. This model may undergo some modifications as the project evolves, adapting to new needs and functionalities that arise during development.
